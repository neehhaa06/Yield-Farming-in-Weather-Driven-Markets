Overview

Weather-Based Yield Farming is a decentralized finance (DeFi) project that combines yield farming with real-time weather data. By integrating weather information into yield farming strategies, users can adjust their yield farming activities based on weather conditions, thereby potentially optimizing their returns and managing risks.
Features

    Weather Data Integration: Utilizes Chainlink's decentralized oracle network to fetch real-time weather data from external sources.
    Yield Adjustment: Dynamically adjusts yield farming strategies based on predefined weather conditions.
    Smart Contract Interaction: Interacts with smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain to trigger yield adjustments.
